# MinitelInterface

Desinged by @Ybalrid

Minitel to RS232 converter circuit (based on a MAX232 IC). Can literally be built with random stuff laying around at RED :wink:

Repository contains a KiCad project to build the board. http://pafgadget.free.fr/bidouillages/minitel/minittl.png

This is based on this circuit from paf gadget, but some filtering capacitor have been muntzed out :open_mouth: . Should be just fine... :wink:
